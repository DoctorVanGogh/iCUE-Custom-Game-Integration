Just a note, if you're gonna actually use the program, I recommend using the exe from 'iCUE HTTP Server -> Complete folder' because it's kinda seperated and all the files can be easily moved there via _getreleasefiles.py (needs WinRAR installed) 

To use the python stuff you'll need to:
- Install python (any version): https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.2/python-3.7.2.exe
- Choose to add python to the PATH variable in install (means you can refer to it as just 'python' in cmd and it'll alias to the install, the iCUE HTTP Server uses this alias)
- Python should install a thing called 'pip', the alias will also be in the PATH variable. It's uses to do package management basically, so it handles the downloading (and updating) of packages. You can use pip to install stuff from https://pypi.org/
- To use the iCUE stuff you'll need the 'requests' library, it has all the HTTP related stuff you'll need. So in cmd, 'pip install requests'

- To use the hotkey stuff in python (see deceitHotkey.py) you'll need to install the libaries located in 'controllers/modules' (in the iCUE HTTP Server -> Complete folder) by doing the following:
	- Open cmd in the modules folder (via 'cd' or however)
	- 'pip install pyHook-1.5.1-cp37-cp37m-win32.whl'
	- 'pip install pywin32-224-cp37-cp37m-win32.whl'
	- 'pywin32_postinstall.py -install'
- When using the hotkey stuff, you can get the (I think correct) keycodes from https://keycode.info/ and then all the logic is handled in the 'OnKeyPress' function in the controller

- Good luck, have fun, any more questions just let me know!
